          <h3>How We Met</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            From simple moments to forever.
            Sometimes the best things in life come when you’re not looking for them. What began as a simple connection quietly grew into something neither of them could imagine living without.
            <br><br>
            They met at work and, without even realizing it, began choosing each other more and more. Hanging out became a daily thing — inventing plans, laughing endlessly, and spending long afternoons at Keren’s parents’ home. It was there that they discovered how effortlessly they connected, bonding over board games, LEGOs, and the simple joy of being together.
            <br><br>
            Their first official date took them to New Orleans for a Matt Rife comedy show. They spent hours walking through Bourbon Street, talking about everything and nothing at all. When they were together, the world seemed to fade away — just the two of them, fully present and completely understood. They were the perfect balance: patience and energy, calm and spark, a love that felt natural from the very beginning.

          <h3>The Proposal</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Now, for someone who can never be kept out of a secret, Keren was completely surprised.
            <br><br>
            What seemed like a normal day hanging out with her best friend turned into something unforgettable. A simple makeover felt innocent — though a little suspicious — until she was asked to wear a white dress she loved. What she didn’t know was that Abe had traveled all the way to Virginia to ask her mom for her hand, making sure everything was done with love and intention. Soon after, back home in Louisiana, in the comfort of their house in Ponchatoula, that quiet preparation turned into the moment that changed everything.
            <br><br>
            And there, surrounded by love and familiarity, two best friends said yes to forever — choosing a lifetime of love, laughter, and a story that was always meant to be.
